*	@brief: This class contains methods for deleting from the back and front of a linked list. Also, this class contains methods that allow a Node object to be added to the front or back of a linkedlist
*   @brief: This class has methods to print the values within the linkedlist, and also has a method for searching for a value in the linkedlist.
    @brief: This class has methods that return the linkedlist size and check if the linkedlist is empty.
