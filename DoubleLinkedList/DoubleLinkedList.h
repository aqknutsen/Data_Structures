*	@brief: This class contains methods for deleting a Node object with a specific value from a Linked List.
    @brief: Also, this class contains methods that allow a Node object to be added:
                To the front of a DoubleLinkedList.
                To the back of a DoubleLinkedList.
                Behind a certain Node Object in a DoubleLinkedList.
                In front of a certain Node Object in a DoubleLinkedList.
*   @brief: This class has methods to print the values within a DoubleLinkedList, and it also has a method for searching for a value in a DoubleLinkedList.
    @brief: This class has methods that return a size of a DoubleLinkedList and check if a DoubleLinkedList is empty.
    @brief: Finally, this class has a constructor and a destructor, used to delete all Node objects in a LinkedList.
